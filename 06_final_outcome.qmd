## Outcome and Pain plots

We will remove the second surgery for all the patients with 2 surgeries

We will also remove the patients with 3 surgeries

Here are the overall trends for the outcome and pain (spaghetti plots)

The outcome will be in the log transformed

![DASH](figure/tsa_dash_score_365day_2023-11-09.png){#fig-outcome}

![Pain](figure/tsa_pain_score_365day_2023-11-09.png){#fig-pain}

Spaghetti Plot

Seems like the pain and DASH sharing the same trend;

It would be interesting to do a multi-outcome joint model.

## Further cleaning for the outcome dataset

```{r}
tsa_baseout <- read.csv("newdata/tsa_clean_baseout_2023-11-07.csv", row.names = 1) %>%
  separate(sid, into = c(NA, "sid")) %>%
  separate(sid, into = c("S", "s"), sep = 1) %>%
  filter(S != 3) %>%
  filter(S != 2 & s != "b") %>%
  filter(outcome_n >= 3) %>%
  tidyr::unite("sid", id:s)


```
